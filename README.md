# Real-Time-Vehicle-Detection-in-Bad-Weather
Most of object detection and tracking algorithms perform sufficiently well under common scenarios, but the detection accuracy drastically decreases under various bad weather conditions, such as rainy days or days with glare, foggy weather. Our work aim is to propose an image enhancement technique to improve the visibility inorder to improve the performance of existing object detection and tracking models.  Furthermore, the proposed system can be implemented without retraining the model. The complementation of the visibility was obtained through the extension of a dark channel prior. The method is being evaluated on multiple surveillance videos by detecting vehicles with the You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) deep learning model. Our follow up work is to make a collision alert system to alert the driver when two vehicles are about to collide in order to prevent accidents.
